# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic. We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s) Props are just a shorter way of saying properties.

  Researched answer: In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The data can be passed from one component to another using these props, similar to how the arguments are passed in a function. However, we cannot change or modify props inside the component as they are immutable.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: The DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is the aspect thats always listening for changes. As a user moves their mouse across the ÃŸcreen, the DOM reacts by changing the view to represent the cursor's position. As developers, we want our web applications to recognize these interactions and respond accordingly depending on the type of event.

  Researched answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM Events are a signal that something has occurred, or is occurring, and can be triggered by user interactions or by the browser. Client-side scripting languages like JavaScript, JScript, ECMAScript, VBScript, and Java register various event handlers or listeners on the elements.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is creating a class into another file. This helps makes programming more efficient because each file is separated into its own properties.

  Researched answer: Functional and Object-Oriented Programming are two different programming techniques that use objects as the key. In functional programs, variables and functions are the main elements of the code. In object-oriented programs, objects and methods are the key elements of a program.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is that a float is a number that contains a decimal point while any number written without decimals is considered an integer.

  Researched answer: Integers and floats are two different kinds of numbers data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means it has a decimal place. Floats are used when more precision is needed.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: In the implicit return method, that is when return isn't explicitly called within a method then Ruby returns the result of an instruction executed before it has even been executed by the user.

  Researched answer: Ruby's 'implicit return' returns the value of the last instruction executed in a method if it isn't explicitly called within that method.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable is similar to a class variable but non-static. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated. They are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class. Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable.

2. PostgreSQL: Postgres is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and compliance. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database. Postgres was developed at the University of California, Berkeley.

3. Ruby on Rails:Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. It provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

4. ORM:Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are referring to a library that implements the technique - hence the phrase "an ORM".

5. Active Record: ActiveRecord is a Ruby on Rails' ORM layer, roughly comparable to Hibernate in Java. It really shines when it comes to simplifying the basic operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. ActiveRecord is based on conventions rather than configuration, so it is easier to work with.
